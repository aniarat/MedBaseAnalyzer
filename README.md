# MedBaseAnalyzer
MedBase Analyzer is a project designed to compare the performance of two popular database systems — MongoDB and PostgreSQL — in the context of managing and querying medical patient data. The application will evaluate how each database handles various types of queries, focusing on response times and efficiency when dealing with large datasets.
